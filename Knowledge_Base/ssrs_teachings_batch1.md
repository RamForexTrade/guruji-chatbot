## Teaching #001: Beyond an Event is Knowledge
**Date:** June 21, 1995  
**Location:** Big Sur  
**Topics:** knowledge, truth, events, maya, infinity, personality, objects, atoms  
**Keywords:** knowledge, event, truth, infinity, love, brahman, personality, object, atom, nancy, anger  
**Problem Categories:** seeking_wisdom, understanding_reality, confusion_about_life  
**Emotional States:** confusion, seeking, questioning  
**Life Situations:** general_guidance, philosophical_inquiry  

### Content:
Beyond an event is Knowledge. Beyond a person is love. Beyond an object is infinity.

Knowledge is not in an event; it is beyond an event. If you take one event and infer anything from one event -- infer knowledge -- it will be erroneous knowledge. Say Nancy gets angry and shouts at someone. You attribute anger to Nancy, but actually it was carried from someone else to her. Someone else got angry first and someone else and someone else and on and on like that.

When you go beyond an event, only then the truth dawns. One particular event gives you a false notion. So you have to consider the totality of events, the totality of all events infinitely. Beyond the event is Knowledge.

What do we call a person? A person is a body, a mind, a complex of behaviors which is changing. Love is unchanging. Beyond the person is love.

When you lose your personality, you become love. If you cannot lose yourself, you cannot find yourself. So, lose your personality; you'll find yourself!!!

Behind every object is infinity. An object is limited. Take an object and reduce, reduce, reduce, and you have an atom. An atom is infinity. Each atom contains infinite space. Beyond the object is infinity.

The object behind the object is infinity. The person behind the person is love.

Maya is getting caught up in the event, personality, object. Knowledge, love, Brahman is seeing beyond the event, personality, or object. See? Just a little shift.

## Teaching #002: Close to the Master
**Date:** June 21, 1995  
**Location:** Big Sur  
**Topics:** guru_relationship, devotion, intimacy, master_disciple, communication, sharing  
**Keywords:** guru, master, close, intimate, share, heart, formal, superficial, burden  
**Problem Categories:** spiritual_relationship, feeling_distant_from_guru, devotion_issues  
**Emotional States:** feeling_disconnected, longing, shame, judgment  
**Life Situations:** spiritual_practice, guru_relationship  

### Content:
If you're not feeling close to the Guru, it's because of you. Because of your mind, because of your ego concepts. Share with the Guru that which is very important or intimate to you. Share that. Do not feel shame, shy, or judgmental about yourself.

Unless you express to the Master that which is very intimate and important to you, just being on the formal and informal communication levels cannot make you feel close. "How are you, where are you going? How have you been?" Stop formal and superficial conversations with the Master and speak with your heart that which is very important and intimate, very deep to your life. Don't just say how much the squash costs, 30 cents or whatever.

If you don't feel close to the Master, there's no point in having a Master. It is just another burden to you. You have enough already. Just say "Goodbye," get rid of it.

**Question:** When you play little games and push us away, how can we feel close to you?

**Answer:** You should feel more close if you are pushed away, scolded or ignored. Because to ignore somebody takes a lot of effort. When a Master does not even ignore wrapping paper, or a flower that is in a vase, how can he ignore a walking, talking, breathing human being who is connected? How could that be ignored? So when you understand this, you already feel close.

**Question:** Can we call you every week?

**Response from the room:** Call Guruji every week and if he doesn't answer the phone then you know you are loved.

**Answer:** Yes, put that in. (Laughter)

You are with the Master to share the joy of the Master, to share the consciousness of the Master. For that, you have to empty your cup of what is already in it. So you share that with the Master. You share whatever you have and don't judge, "Oh, that is garbage." The Master is ready to accept any garbage of any extent. However you are, he will embrace you. He is ready to share. You only have to share from your side.

## Teaching #003: Prabdha Karma and Sanchita Karma
**Date:** June 21, 1995  
**Location:** Big Sur  
**Topics:** karma, spiritual_practice, satsang, surrender, cooking_analogies  
**Keywords:** karma, prabdha, sanchita, praise, blame, surrender, halwa, soji, buttermilk  
**Problem Categories:** understanding_karma, spiritual_confusion, blame_issues  
**Emotional States:** confusion_about_karma, feeling_blamed  
**Life Situations:** spiritual_practice, dealing_with_blame  

### Content:
Some karma can be changed and some cannot.

When you prepare halwa, if sugar is less or ghee is less, water more or less, it can all be adjusted, repaired. But once soji is cooked, it cannot be reversed.

If the buttermilk is sour, milk can be added, salt can be added to make it drinkable. But it can never be reversed back to milk.

Prabdha karma cannot be changed. Sanchita karma can be changed by spiritual practices. Satsang burns the seed of all negative karma.

When you praise someone, you take on their good karma. When you blame someone you take on their bad karma.

Know this and surrender both good and bad karma to the Divine and be free.

## Teaching #004: Only Speak Knowledge
**Date:** June 21, 1995  
**Location:** Big Sur  
**Topics:** speech, knowledge, conflict, peace, blame, gita, krishna, arjuna  
**Keywords:** knowledge, speak, blame, conflict, comfort, self, gita, krishna, arjuna, fight  
**Problem Categories:** communication_issues, dealing_with_conflict, gossip_problems  
**Emotional States:** conflict, discomfort, blame, upset  
**Life Situations:** relationships, communication, workplace_conflict  

### Content:
Only speak Knowledge. Don't repeat anything that someone tells you or opinions about anyone that someone states -- "That so-and-so said such-and-such about you." If someone comes to tell you such things, discourage them. Don't believe it.

If someone blames you directly, know that they are taking away your bad karma and let it go. Don't believe in it, and if you're one of the Guru's close ones, you will take all of the blame of the world with a smile.

Conflict is the nature of the world; comfort is the nature of the self. Amidst the conflict seek the comfort.

When you are bored with the comfort, get into the games of the world. When you are tired of the games of the world, get into the comforts of the Self. If you are one of the Guru's close ones, you do both simultaneously. Trying to end conflict prolongs it. Face the conflict by seeking the comfort of the Self.

God is alive in the world and has been putting up with all the ongoing conflicts throughout the ages. If God can put up with all the conflicts, you can too. The moment you agree to be with the conflict, the conflict disappears.

People who love peace do not want to fight, and those who fight do not love peace. Those who want peace want to run away. What is needed here is to be peaceful within and then fight. The whole message of the Gita is to be peaceful yourself and then fight. Krishna tells Arjuna to fight but be in peace at the same time. Does this ring a bell?

In the world, you resolve one conflict and another one comes up. For example, Russia is solved and then Bosnia arises. You make one better, and then another starts up. Your body gets a cold, then you get better; then your back hurts, then it gets better. Your body gets better, and then the mind goes. The world runs like this, isn't it?

Without any intention, misunderstandings happen. It's not up to you to try to resolve them. Ignore them and be alive.

## Teaching #005: Master is a Doorway
**Date:** June 21, 1995  
**Location:** Big Sur  
**Topics:** master, presence, relationships, security, infinity, doorway, shelter  
**Keywords:** master, doorway, presence, relationships, security, infinity, charming, shelter  
**Problem Categories:** understanding_guru_role, spiritual_relationship, insecurity  
**Emotional States:** seeking_security, relationship_confusion, fear  
**Life Situations:** spiritual_seeking, relationship_issues  

### Content:
Master is a doorway. And the doorway needs to be more charming than the world so that you will come to the doorway. Someone is in the street and there is rain, thunder, hot sun; they need shelter. They look around, they find a doorway. They come to the doorway. The doorway is more inviting, more charming, more celebrative, more joyful than anything else in the world.

Nothing could give that much peace, joy, pleasure in the world. Once you come to the doorway, you enter the door and see the world from there. See the world from the eyes of the Master. This is a sign that you have come to the Master. Otherwise you may still be standing in the street and looking at the door.

But once you have entered the door, then you will see the whole world from the eyes of the Master. This means what? In every situation that you face, you will think, "If this situation comes in front of the Master, how would he handle it?" or "How would she handle it?" "If this complication comes in front of the Master, how would he take it?" "If someone blames the Master like this, how would he handle it?" See the world from the eyes of the Master all the time.

The world looks much more beautiful; not a nasty place. But a place filled with love, filled with joy, cooperation, compassion, and all virtues. The world is much more fun. Looking through the doorway, there is no fear. You will look at the world without any fear. You will be in all relationships with everybody without any fear. Because there is shelter.

From inside home, you will look at the thunder, you will look at the storm, you will look at the rain, you will look at the bright sun. Inside you have air conditioning. Very cool, pleasant. Outside it's hot. You don't mind because there is nothing that can really distract you, disturb you, or take the fullness away from you. Such a sense of security, such a sense of fullness and joy comes. That is the purpose of having a Master.

All relationships in the world go topsy-turvy. You make relationships and you break relationships. All relationships can get broken or made up and again broken. And there is craving and aversion. This is the world. This is samsara.

But the Master is not a relationship. The Master is the Presence. What is necessary is to feel the Presence of the Master, not to make a relationship. Don't make the Master a part of your world. Then the same, "Oh, he looked at me." "He didn't look at me." "Oh, he said this." "He didn't say that." "Oh, somebody is close. I am not close." All this garbage comes into it. You feel the Presence of the Master, that is eternal. That has been there with you before, now, and will be there in the future, too.

Master is the Presence. World is relativity. And relativity has limitations. Presence is unlimited. Presence is vast, infinite, and all comprehensive, all inclusive. And the presence of the Master in one's life will bring fulfillment to all relations. Every relationship will become complete with the presence of the Infinity if the Master is in your life.

## Teaching #006: Doubt
**Date:** June 21, 1995  
**Location:** Big Sur  
**Topics:** doubt, decision_making, acceptance, conviction, gray_area, black_white  
**Keywords:** doubt, gray, black, white, accept, conviction, eyes, bones, hemoglobin  
**Problem Categories:** doubt_confusion, decision_making, unclear_thinking  
**Emotional States:** confusion, uncertainty, indecision  
**Life Situations:** decision_making, unclear_situations  

### Content:
A doubt is a gray area. Gray is something which is neither white nor black. Now, how to solve the doubt? An event, knowledge, convention cannot help. Then what can help? Accepting it either as black or as white. Put it either as black and accept it or as white and accept it -- whether or not it is black or white. And see the gray as a shade of black or white. Either way you accept it. Honest or dishonest -- accept it. Then the mind is quiet. You are not in the gray area.

See, the eyes are dark, eyebrows are dark, the thymus -- the most powerful organ of the body -- is black. Hemoglobin -- the main force of the body -- is black. You cannot survive without black. It is part of you.

Or see it as white. Eye is also white. Bones are white; the structure on which the whole body stands is white. Put it in a category of black -- no problem -- accept. Put it in a category of white -- no problem -- doubt is not there. Have conviction. "I accept. They are dishonest and still part of me." That's it. Finished.

Doubt is wanting to get rid of something. Doubt is a temporary state. Neither up nor below. There tension arises.

## Teaching #007: Fire
**Date:** June 21, 1995  
**Location:** Big Sur  
**Topics:** senses, fire, purity, samyama, saint, celebration, cremation  
**Keywords:** fire, senses, burn, sandalwood, pollution, samyama, camphor, ghee_lamp, toxic  
**Problem Categories:** sense_control, spiritual_practice, purity_issues  
**Emotional States:** being_overwhelmed_by_senses, seeking_purity  
**Life Situations:** spiritual_practice, self_control  

### Content:
The senses are like fire. Your life is also like fire. In the fire of senses, whatever you put in burns. If you burn tires, it creates pollution and bad smell. But if you burn sandalwood, it creates fragrance.

Celebration happens around the bonfire. Grief happens around the fire of cremation. The same fire that supports life in winter, can also destroy. One fire, like a ghee lamp, lights your way and purifies. Another fire made of toxic material creates pollution.

You are also like fire. Are you the fire that creates smoke and pollution or the flame of camphor which creates light and fragrance? A saint is like a camphor flame that creates light and the fragrance of love. He is the friend of life.

The fire that creates light and warmth and is useful is of higher quality. The fire that creates light and a little smoke as well is of medium quality. The fire that creates darkness and only smoke is of low quality. Learn to distinguish the different fires. If your senses are engaged in goodness, then you will create light and fragrance. If engaged in impurity, you create smoke and darkness. It is samyama that transforms the quality of fire in you. Next week we will discuss samyama.

## Teaching #008: Habits and Vows
**Date:** June 21, 1995  
**Location:** Big Sur  
**Topics:** habits, vows, samyama, discipline, vasanas, time_bound, conduct  
**Keywords:** habits, vows, vasanas, samyama, time_bound, discipline, wayward, smoking, cursing  
**Problem Categories:** bad_habits, lack_of_discipline, addiction_issues  
**Emotional States:** frustrated_with_habits, lacking_willpower  
**Life Situations:** breaking_bad_habits, self_improvement  

### Content:
How to get rid of vasanas (impressions)? This is a question for all those who want to come out of habits.

You want to get rid of habits because they give pain and restrict you. The nature of vasana is to bother you, or bind you, and wanting to be free is the nature of life. Life wants to be free and when a soul doesn't know how to be free, it wanders through lifetimes wanting freedom.

The way to come out of habits is vows. This is samyama. Everybody is endowed with a little samyama.

A vow should be time bound. This would bring good conduct and save you from being wayward. Consider the time and place for vows to be taken.

When the mind dwells on useless thoughts, then two things happen. One is that all those old patterns come up and you feel discouraged by them. You blame yourself and feel that you have not made any progress.

The second thing is that you see it as an opportunity for samyama and feel happy about it. Without samyama, life will not be happy and diseases arise. For example, you know you should not eat three servings of ice cream, or eat ice cream every day, or otherwise you will get sick.

Habits will clog you when there is no liveliness or juice in life. When there is a direction for life force, you can rise above habits through samyama.

Take vows according to time and place. For example, suppose someone has a habit of smoking cigarettes and says, "I will quit smoking," but cannot do it. They can take a vow, three months or 90 days; a time-bound vow. If someone is used to cursing and swearing, take a vow not to use bad language for ten days. Don't take it for a lifetime; you will break it immediately. If you happen to break it in between, don't worry. Just begin again. Slowly increase the duration until it becomes your nature.

All those habits which bother you, bind them in vows, in samyama. So all those who are in Satsang, take a time-bound vow today and make a note of it. If you break a vow, make a note of it and share the time and date at the next Satsang. Continue it again. Tie those habits which bring you pain in samyama.

## Teaching #009: Dealing with Blame
**Date:** June 21, 1995  
**Location:** Big Sur  
**Topics:** blame, karma, resistance, enlightenment, negative_karma  
**Keywords:** blame, karma, resistance, hurt, enlightened, negative_karma, lighter  
**Problem Categories:** dealing_with_criticism, feeling_hurt, blame_issues  
**Emotional States:** feeling_hurt, being_blamed, sadness  
**Life Situations:** criticism, workplace_issues, relationship_conflicts  

### Content:
When someone blames you, what do you usually do? Blame them back or you put up resistance in yourself. When someone blames you, they actually take away some negative karma from you. If you understand this and don't put up resistance and feel happy about it, then you drop your resistance. "Oh, good. That person is blaming me. Good. Something is going away." And when you drop the resistance, your karma goes away. Do you see what I'm saying?

So when someone blames you and you put up resistance in your mind, and you don't react, then you are not allowing them to take the negative karma. Outside you may resist, but inside if you don't resist, and feel happy, "Oh, good, somebody is there to blame me and take some negative karma," you will feel immediately lighter.

How does it feel to you when someone blames you? Do you feel some heaviness? Usually, when someone blames you, you feel hurt and you feel unhappy, you feel sad. This is all because you're . . . resisting. That is it. What you resist, persists. The ignorant person tells someone, "Don't blame me because it hurts me."

An enlightened person also says "Don't blame me." Do you know why? Because it might hurt you. This is a beautiful point. What are the points? You get hurt because you resist the blame. When someone blames you, you resist it inside. Outside you may not resist, but inside when you resist, then that hurts you.

An ignorant person warns you, "You better not hurt me, you better not blame me because I will feel hurt." Someone warns you not to blame them because it will hurt them and they'll do something harmful to you out of revenge.

An enlightened person says "Don't blame me because it will hurt you." So here you say, don't blame because of compassion. You can tell someone, don't blame me out of compassion, or you can say it out of anger.

## Teaching #010: Krishna's Birthday - Center of Attraction
**Date:** August 1995 (Krishna Janmashtami)  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** krishna, attraction, divine, radha, consciousness, anasuya  
**Keywords:** krishna, attraction, divine, radha, center, beautiful, formless, shell, trick  
**Problem Categories:** understanding_attraction, spiritual_seeking, divine_love  
**Emotional States:** attraction, longing, seeking  
**Life Situations:** spiritual_seeking, understanding_relationships  

### Content:
Krishna means the most attractive . . . It is the divinity that is the most attractive; the energy that pulls everything to it. Krishna is the formless center which is everywhere. Any attraction from anywhere is coming only from Krishna. Often people fail to see the spirit behind the attraction and merely hold on to the outer shell. And the moment you try to possess the shell, you will see Krishna has played a trick and you will be left with an empty shell in your hands and tears in your eyes.

Be clever like Radha -- don't be tricked by Krishna. Krishna could not escape from Radha, for her whole world was filled with Krishna. If you can see that wherever there is an attraction, there is Krishna; then you are Radha, you are in your center.

The mind moves towards beauty, joy and truth. Krishna tells Arjuna, "I am the beauty in the Beautiful, the strength in the Strong, the wisdom in the Wise." In this way he arrests the mind from moving away from him.

Krishna reveals this Knowledge to Arjuna because he is Anasuya. Next week we will see what is Anasuya.

## Teaching #011: Anasuya - Devoid of Fault-Finding
**Date:** August 1995  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** anasuya, fault_finding, knowledge, vision, discrimination, cataract, mirror  
**Keywords:** anasuya, fault, vision, knowledge, cataract, mirror, royal_secret, consciousness  
**Problem Categories:** fault_finding, negative_thinking, judgment_issues  
**Emotional States:** finding_fault, negativity, judgment  
**Life Situations:** relationships, workplace, general_interactions  

### Content:
Knowledge will be different at different levels of consciousness. At a particular level of consciousness you will become anasuya. Anasuya is devoid of fault-finding eyes. If a mirror is dusty, you need a duster to clean it. But if your eyes have a cataract, any amount of dusting will not help. So first you have to remove the cataract. Then you can see that the mirror is already clean.

There is a certain mind set that always finds fault, even in the best conditions in the world. When you give a person with this mind set the best, they still find faults. Even with the best possible companion, or the most beautiful painting, they will still find something wrong. That kind of mind set cannot know the sacred Knowledge. Krishna tells Arjuna that he is giving him the Royal Secret, because he is anasuya. "You are not finding fault in Me, even though you are so close."

From a distance, even craters cannot be seen. Even on a smooth surface there will be holes. If you are only interested in the holes, you will not see the magnanimity of things. If you are not in anasuya, Knowledge cannot blossom in you. Then there is no point in giving Knowledge.

**Question:** What about discrimination -- Wisdom?

**Answer:** If it is in your vision, your vision will find discrimination. The moment you are out of the path, everything is all wrong, that is not anasuya. For example, you have a friendship, and after 10 years you decide to leave. When you leave, you do not see the good in that relationship. You find fault. This is not anasuya.

However, once you discover you have the wrong vision, half of the wrong vision has already disappeared. There is a fine line here. There cannot be any better example than the cataract. Instead of saying, "My vision is blurred," you say, "The whole world is not sharp." Suppose someone is coming in. It is windy, so you shut the door. But the person thinks the door has been slammed in his face! This is asuya. It is not anasuya. Most of the population is like this.

Asuya is finding fault. It is seeing malicious intent everywhere. It is like a child who says, "Mother, you don't love me!" The child's vision is wrong. If the mother does not love the child, who will? It is the same as if someone comes and says, "Guruji, you don't love me!" If I don't love them, forget about it. Nobody else in the world will! Where else will they find love? Nowhere. A mother may get frustrated but not a Master.

**Question:** It seems as though you can't have anasuya unless you are enlightened?

**Answer:** Not always. This is an excuse. To get enlightenment, you must have this vision.

## Teaching #012: Love of the Ignorant vs Anger of the Enlightened
**Date:** August 1995  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** love, anger, enlightenment, ignorance, blessing, discipline, mother, master  
**Keywords:** love, anger, ignorant, enlightened, blessing, mother, master, child, spoiled  
**Problem Categories:** understanding_discipline, spiritual_guidance, tough_love  
**Emotional States:** confusion_about_discipline, feeling_punished  
**Life Situations:** spiritual_guidance, parenting, mentorship  

### Content:
The love of the ignorant can be harmful yet even the anger of the Enlightened is not harmful. It can be only good!

An example is the school at the Art of Living Ashram in Bangalore. 250 children are enrolled but only 200 come to class on any given day. Fifty children don't show up. Why? They cry at home, "Mother, I don't want to go to school."

The mother says, "Oh, la la, don't cry . . . ok." She thinks, "No child in the world is like my child." And so she sticks up for the child and begins to speak for him. She does not see the teacher's point of view. The mother asks the teacher, "Why are you not teaching my child properly? He is so innocent, so lovely." So, what happens -- the child grows up spoiled. The love in the mother's ignorance has spoiled the child. The child will never learn the alphabet, never learn to read or write, but the mother says, "Oh, never mind, there are sheep to look after and fields to tend." The mother's love in ignorance has spoiled the child.

The anger of the Enlightened is a blessing. There are many instances of this in the Puranas. Once a Master was traveling in the middle province of India with a disciple following him a few yards behind. Some boys who were rude, rough, and abusive began to throw stones and tease the disciple calling him names. This went on for some time as the boys followed the Master and the disciple. They came to a river. The Master and the disciple got into a boat in order to cross. The boys got in another boat which started to sink in the middle of the river.

The Master slapped the disciple across the face. The disciple was so surprised as he had not said a word back to the boys in response to their taunts. He had been such a good disciple and yet the Master had slapped him!

The Master said, "It is your fault. You are responsible for their boat sinking. You did not respond to their abuse. Nature has now punished them in a worse way because you did not have enough compassion to quell their insults."

The slap that the Master gave took away the karma of this event such that it would not be carried into the future of the boys. It also served to take away any little bit of joy the disciple may have felt at seeing the boys' boat sink! Thus, it also took away the karma of the event for the disciple. So, the anger of the Enlightened is a blessing!

## Teaching #013: A Liar is Innocent
**Date:** August 1995  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** lies, innocence, trust, love, honesty, feelings, mental_gymnastics  
**Keywords:** liar, innocent, trust, caught, love, melt, sadness, anger, cheated  
**Problem Categories:** trust_issues, dealing_with_lies, relationship_problems  
**Emotional States:** feeling_cheated, disappointment, sadness, anger  
**Life Situations:** relationships, trust_issues, betrayal  

### Content:
A dear person whom you trust lies to you and gets caught. What do you feel? Sadness, anger, cheated, disappointment, compassion, let down, loss of respect, wonder, shock, embarrassment.

Recently when someone lied to me, I felt happy and more love, for they were not a good liar. Had they been a good liar, they would not have been caught. I thought they were so innocent that they could not even lie properly. They lie and get caught. If they had not been caught, how would you know they were a liar? So . . . you can never know a good liar. The person you call a liar is not a good liar and they are innocent. Aren't they?

And so . . . ha ha (laugh). You need not go through all the listed mental gymnastics. Instead melt and dissolve in Love.

## Teaching #014: Be a Gopal
**Date:** August 1995  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** knowledge, friendship, gopal, protection, satsang, mind, seeking, blossoming  
**Keywords:** gopal, knowledge, friend, protector, satsang, mind, go, pal, big_mind  
**Problem Categories:** friendship_issues, knowledge_sharing, spiritual_community  
**Emotional States:** seeking_true_friendship, loneliness  
**Life Situations:** building_friendships, spiritual_community  

### Content:
Like fish in the water, you are in air. Thoughts are in mind. Mind is in Big Mind. The Big Mind in Me is love. Emotions are ripples in love. Love is all Knowledge.

Every atom of Big Mind is crammed with Knowledge. Knowing this, you stop seeking. You seek until you come to the Master. You walk until you come to the swimming pool. You don't walk or run in the swimming pool -- you swim or float. Once you come to the Master, seeking stops, blossoming begins.

You are Knowledge. Every atom in you is shimmering with Knowledge. This is called Go. Be a Go-Pal. Be a friend in Knowledge.

Go has four meanings:
- Knowledge
- Movement  
- Achievement
- Freedom or liberation

Pal means friend or protector -- one who takes care of.

Often you become friends by:
- Gossiping about negative things
- Complaining
- Similar cravings or aversions
- Common enemies or common problems
- Common goals or common addictions

Coming together in Knowledge is rare. You become friends because you have something in common. Be a friend in Knowledge. Uplift each other in Knowledge. All Satsangees are Gopals -- reminding each other, coming together in and for Knowledge. That is Gopal. Be a protector of this Knowledge.

Smiling with all the Existence is silence!

## Teaching #016: Big Mind
**Date:** August 1995  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** mind, big_mind, small_mind, joy, misery, guru, victory, dignified, playful  
**Keywords:** big_mind, small_mind, joy, misery, guru, victory, jaya, deva, dignified, playful  
**Problem Categories:** mental_confusion, joy_issues, understanding_mind  
**Emotional States:** misery, joy, mental_conflict  
**Life Situations:** mental_health, spiritual_understanding  

### Content:
You know there is a Big Mind and a small mind. Sometimes the Big Mind wins over the small mind and sometimes it is the other way around.

When the small mind wins over, it is misery and when the Big Mind wins, it is joy.

Small mind promises joy and leaves your hand empty. Big Mind may bring resistance in the beginning but fills you with joy.

The word Guru means great. Jaya means victory. Deva means one who is fun-loving, playful, light. One who is playful is often not dignified and when one is dignified, he is often not playful.

Jai Guru Dev is victory to the Big Mind in you that is both dignified and playful. That is what Jai Guru Dev means: "Victory to the Greatness in you."

You do not say victory or hail to the Master as he has won over already. You say victory to your own Self, your own Mind, which is being veiled by the small mind.

## Teaching #017: The Only Thing You Must Remember
**Date:** August 1995  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** fortune, gratitude, sorrow, self, joy, knowledge, awareness, completion  
**Keywords:** fortunate, sorrow, self, joy, knowledge, awareness, negative_qualities, positive_qualities  
**Problem Categories:** depression, sadness, ingratitude, self_pity  
**Emotional States:** sadness, depression, feeling_unfortunate  
**Life Situations:** general_life_challenges, depression  

### Content:
The only thing you must remember is how fortunate you are.

When you forget this you become sad. Sorrow indicates (I) your negative qualities, and (ii) your attachment to your positive qualities. When you think you are too good, you blame the world; then you become sad. The purpose of sorrow is to bring you back to the self. And self is all Joy. But this is possible only through Knowledge -- awareness.

Knowledge or awareness leads sorrow towards the self. With lack of Knowledge, the same sorrow multiplies and does not get completed. Knowledge completes sorrow.

With the power of Knowledge you transcend sorrow. In this path you have everything. We have this beautiful Knowledge which has all the flavors in it -- wisdom, laughter, seva, silence, singing, dancing, humor, celebration, yagyas, caring, complaints, problems, complications, and chaos to add color.

Life is so colorful!

## Teaching #018: Freedom and Discipline
**Date:** August 1995  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** freedom, discipline, defense, awareness, love, fear, soldiers, police, restrictions  
**Keywords:** freedom, discipline, defense, awareness, love, fear, soldiers, police, restrictions, advaita  
**Problem Categories:** discipline_issues, feeling_restricted, balance_in_life  
**Emotional States:** feeling_restricted, seeking_freedom  
**Life Situations:** self_discipline, work_life_balance  

### Content:
Freedom and discipline are opposites and complementary. The purpose of defense is to protect freedom. But is there freedom in defense? Do soldiers have freedom? No, they are totally bound, not even allowed to put the right foot down when told the left foot. Their steps are measured and they are unable even to walk with a natural rhythm. There is total lack of freedom in defense. That which has absolutely no freedom is protecting the freedom of the country! So it is with the police; they protect the freedom of the individual. But are they free?

Discipline protects freedom. They both go hand in hand. Understand this and go ahead in life. You have some restrictions and it is this that allows you freedom. You can choose to focus either on freedom or discipline, and this makes you happy or unhappy. Freedom without discipline is like a country without a defense.

Fences should be fences; a fence cannot be built all over the property. If your fence is all over, how can you build on the property? That state of high absolute freedom is too difficult; we need to be very practical. Yes, there is a state of unlimited bliss, the freedom Advaita talks about. The Advaita Knowledge has been totally misused or used according to one's own fancies and conveniences.

There must be awareness in the mind, love in the heart, and righteousness in action.

Love and fear are two possibilities that put you on track. The Jewish religion put fear as the main thing so that life could improve. Nature induces fear at a certain age in a child. When a child is very young, it gets 100 percent time and love of the mother. The child has no fear. As the child grows more independent it becomes cautious. Nature brings in an iota of fear. With freedom, the child starts walking carefully. Fear of losing freedom also brings defense. The purpose of defense is to eliminate fear.

On this path Knowledge is your Freedom.

## Teaching #019: Discipleship Ends - Shishya or Sakha
**Date:** August 1995  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** discipleship, companionship, knowledge, love, shishya, sakha, boat, ceremony  
**Keywords:** shishya, sakha, disciple, companion, knowledge, love, boat, samavartha, arjuna, krishna  
**Problem Categories:** spiritual_relationship, understanding_guru_connection  
**Emotional States:** confusion_about_spiritual_relationship  
**Life Situations:** spiritual_development, guru_relationship  

### Content:
Knowledge has an end. Knowledge completes. So also does discipleship. For the disciple is aimed at acquiring Knowledge.

Once you cross the water, however nice the boat is, you get off the boat. After twelve years, the disciple completes his studies. The master does a ceremony called Samavartha, where he tells the disciple that he is ending the discipleship and asking him to behave at par with him, and let the Brahman dynamically manifest.

Sakha is a companion in life and death; it never ends. In the path of love there is neither beginning nor end. Sakha only wants the beloved. He doesn't care about the Knowledge or liberation. Love is incomplete because of longing. And so it is infinite, for infinity can never be complete.

Arjuna was a sakha to Krishna and although Krishna was the perfect Master he was a sakha, too. What are you, a shishya (disciple) or a sakha (companion)?

## Teaching #020: Sakha - Your Reliable Sense
**Date:** August 1995  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** self, senses, companion, sukha, dukha, sakha, kha, world, mud, mind  
**Keywords:** sakha, senses, self, joy, sorrow, companion, wisdom, kha, sukha, dukha, mud  
**Problem Categories:** understanding_relationships, spiritual_companionship  
**Emotional States:** seeking_reliable_companionship  
**Life Situations:** relationships, spiritual_friendship  

### Content:
There are three things: the Self, the senses, and the object, or the world. And there are three words: sukha, pleasure; dukha, sorrow; and sakha, companion. These have one thing in common: "kha," which means "senses."

The Self through the senses experiences the world. When the senses are with the Self, that is pleasure (sukha), because the Self is the source of all joy or pleasure. When the senses are away from the Self (dukha) -- in the mud, lost in the object -- that is misery. Mud, misery, mind -- they are very close.

Self --- Senses ("Kha") --- World
--- Joy (Sukha)   Sorrow (Dukha) ---

Self is the nature of joy. In any pleasant experience, you close your eyes; you smell a nice flower, or you taste or touch something. So sukha is that which takes you to the Self. Dukha is that which takes you away from the Self. Sorrow simply means that you are caught up in the object, which goes on changing, instead of focussing on the Self.

All the sense objects are just a diving board to take you back to the Self.

Sa-kha, companion, means: "He is the senses." Sakha is one who has become your senses, who is your senses. If you are my senses, it means I get Knowledge through you; you are my sixth sense. As I trust my mind, so I trust you. A friend could be just an object of the senses, but a sakha has become the very senses.

The sakha is the companion who is there in both the experiences of the dukha and of sukha. It means one who leads you back to the Self. If you are stuck in an object, that wisdom which pulls you back to the Self is sakha.

Knowledge is your companion and your companion is Knowledge. And the Master is nothing but the embodiment of Knowledge. So sakha means, "He is my senses, I see the world through that wisdom, through Him."

If your sense is the Divine, then you see the whole world through the Divinity.

Your head will be in the mud in a few years;
Don't put mud in your head while you are still alive.

## Teaching #021: Scepticism
**Date:** September 1995  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** scepticism, faith, love, possibilities, silence, paradigm, science, children  
**Keywords:** sceptic, faith, love, possibilities, silence, children, paradigm, scientist, creation  
**Problem Categories:** doubt_issues, lack_of_faith, closed_mindedness  
**Emotional States:** doubt, scepticism, resistance  
**Life Situations:** spiritual_seeking, dealing_with_doubters  

### Content:
Ignorance is being a sceptic and not knowing you are a sceptic. If you think you are a sceptic, you are no longer a sceptic because you have a clue of something beyond. 

A sceptic is stuck in a paradigm and closes all other possibilities. But this creation is of all possibilities. A real scientist can never afford to be a sceptic because scepticism closes down possibilities. 

In every human being deep inside, there is faith and love. What you think is scepticism is only a thin layer. Your silence and the smile from your heart will dispel their scepticism. Like a child's presence will bring out the child in everybody, your innocence and spontaneity will rekindle faith in the hardest core sceptics. A sceptic is waiting for a true seeker -- someone whose faith is unshaken.

## Teaching #022: Shaucha and Ashaucha
**Date:** September 1995  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** purity, impurity, self, misery, shaucha, ashaucha, death, relatives, gita  
**Keywords:** shaucha, ashaucha, pure, impure, self, misery, clarity, death, relatives, gita  
**Problem Categories:** feeling_impure, depression, spiritual_cleansing  
**Emotional States:** feeling_dirty, depression, misery  
**Life Situations:** spiritual_purification, overcoming_depression  

### Content:
When you are miserable, what has happened is that you have gone away from the Self. This is called Ashaucha. It means you have become unclean.

In India when someone dies, the close relatives are said to be Ashaucha for 10 days because they are very sad. After 10 days of just being with that experience and reading the Gita, being with the Knowledge and pulling themselves back into the Self, then it is called Shaucha.

Shaucha's benefits are clarity in the intellect, a pleasing mind, focused awareness in the mind, a say over the senses, and therefore eligibility to realize the Self. When you are depressed you cannot realize the Self. When you are unhappy, you cannot realize the Self.

## Teaching #023: Boredom and Sadhana

**Location:** Not specified

**Problem Categories:** boredom_in_practice, spiritual_dryness, meditation_issues  
**Emotional States:** boredom, spiritual_dryness, lack_of_interest  
**Life Situations:** spiritual_practice, meditation  

### Content:
What is boredom? A repetition without interest or love causes a monotonous state of mind; that is boredom. It overshadows the Self.

A practice or abhyasa is again a repetition whose purpose is to destroy the boredom and reunite with the Self. Whether the practice gives you joy or boredom, it must be continued. Pleasantness or unpleasantness should not be a criteria for doing the practice. Only the practice or abhyasa can annihilate the Mind.

Self is Love and Love is always repetitive. If you are bored with yourself then how much more boring you would be for others. If you find people boring, it indicates that you are boring. 

Root out the boredom in you through deep and continued meditation.

In Guru shakti, all three shaktis have blossomed fully. So each of you first identify which shakti you have more of and aspire for Guru shakti.

**Keywords:** events, problems, skill, sadhana, grace, mistakes, humble, vehicle

**Emotional States:** feeling_overwhelmed, stuck_in_problems

All the problems that you face in life are because you attach over importance to the events. The events grow bigger while you remain smaller.

Suppose there is a very slow vehicle in front of you. You have three options:
1. You can complain, somehow bear with it, and still follow the vehicle.
2. You can slow down or wait for some time.
3. You can use your skill, overtake the vehicle, and forget about it.

Wise people use their skill and grow over the events.

Conditioning the vehicle is sadhana or practice. And skill is the grace of the Guru. The mistakes that you have made in the past have made you humble; you need not make mistakes in the future to become humble.

## Teaching #028: The Washing Machine
**Date:** October 1995

**Keywords:** washing_machine, body, mind, knowledge, birth, purification, cycles, dirt, detergent  
**Problem Categories:** understanding_rebirth, spiritual_purification, life_purpose  
**Emotional States:** confusion_about_life_purpose, spiritual_seeking  
**Life Situations:** spiritual_understanding, life_cycles  

### Content:
Our body is like a washing machine, our mind is like cloth, each lifetime is one run or cycle, and Knowledge is detergent. The mind comes into the body to get cleansed and pure. But instead of detergent, if you use dirt, then you have dirty clothes.

Pure water is like love, Knowledge is like detergent, mind is like cloth, and the body like the washing machine. If you put in mud instead of detergent, your clothes become dirtier than before.

You will have to go on putting clothes in the washing machine to get them cleaned. Similarly you will have many more births until you stop repeating the mistakes that you have made.

Review the year while you celebrate. What did you do? What did you achieve? How useful were you this past year? With a flower, on New Year's Day, offer the whole year to the Divine.

**SPREADING THE FRAGRANCE**

It is not enough simply to have the fragrance. We have to know how to spread it. Flowers have the fragrance, but it is the wind that comes and spreads it.

In the same way, each one of us is wonderful within -- we are beautiful, caring, and loving. But we do not know how to spread the fragrance. Satsang is that wind which comes and spreads this fragrance to everyone.

The message for 1996 is... JUST BE! Relax and just be. That doesn't mean be lazy... No! Be very busy... and just be.

The events come and go, they perish like flowers. But every event and every person contains some honey. Like a bee, just take the honey out of every event and every moment and move on. Be like a busy bee and be in the Being.

**Emotional States:** attachment_to_external_pleasures  
**Life Situations:** enjoying_life, creating_sacred_space  

### Content:
All sensory pleasures in the world are like wrapping paper; the true bliss is the present inside. Divine love is the present, yet we are holding onto the paper believing we have already enjoyed the gift.

It's like putting the chocolate inside your mouth with the paper still on. A little chocolate may seep into the mouth, but the covering makes sores in the mouth. Unwrap the present.

The wise know how to enjoy the gift inside, while the ignorant get stuck with the paper. I want every home to be an Ashram. How many of you consider your home to be an Ashram?

**Problem Categories:** understanding_guru_nature, spiritual_paradox  
**Emotional States:** confusion_about_guru, wanting_to_please  
**Life Situations:** spiritual_relationship, understanding_paradoxes  

### Content:
A student's job is to satisfy the Master. But how can you satisfy someone who is already satisfied?

If Guru is satisfied, then your growth is shunned. If Guru is unsatisfied, he's away from the Self. If Guru is satisfied, then what can inspire you to grow? If he's unsatisfied, he cannot be a Guru. If he's satisfied, he cannot be a Guru.

So what is the answer?

## Teaching #033: Advice from Hawaii - Give Quality Time

**Emotional States:** spiritual_dryness, frustration_with_prayers  
**Life Situations:** spiritual_practice, time_management  

### Content:
What type of time do you give the Divine? Usually you give the time that is leftover, when you have nothing else to do, when no guests are coming, there are no parties to go to, no nice movies to watch, no weddings to attend.

Give quality time to the Divine. It will be rewarded. If your prayers are not answered it is because you have never given quality time. Give Satsang and meditation your highest priority. Give prime time to the Divine. You definitely will be rewarded.

What is most freely given yet not taken? The answer is "advice." Advice hangs in the space, the giver goes on giving, the taker never takes.

If you are unhappy, even the moon is irritating to you. When you are calm and centered inside, noise is musical, clouds are magical, rain is liquid sunshine. Book yourself on a trip to this most beautiful place in the universe.

**Keywords:** abundance, indebtedness, gratitude, god, received, thankful, own  
**Problem Categories:** financial_worry, lack_mentality, ingratitude  
**Emotional States:** feeling_lack, financial_stress, ingratitude  
**Life Situations:** financial_challenges, abundance_mindset  

### Content:
God is all abundant, all full and we are connected to God. Then why are we in debt? How can you be indebted and at the same time have abundance?

If you don't feel indebted, you cannot have abundance. So the more indebted you feel, the more abundance you have. Feel indebtedness and gratitude, then abundance comes. When you know you own God, you are not in a hurry to get something out of God.

## Teaching #036: Abiding in the Self - Valentine's Message

**Location:** Not specified

**Keywords:** self, valentine, spirit, matter, love, heart, everywhere, reside  
**Problem Categories:** loneliness, lack_of_love, relationship_issues  
**Emotional States:** loneliness, seeking_love  
**Life Situations:** valentine's_day, relationships, self_love  

### Content:
Abiding in the self you become the valentine for the whole world. Spirit is the valentine of matter and matter is the valentine of the spirit. They are made for each other. They uphold each other.

If you hold onto matter and do not respect the spirit, then matter is not pleased. If you honor the spirit then you will care for the world, and when you care for the world, it will take care of you.

I am the valentine of the whole world and I reside in every heart. If you are my valentine, you will see me everywhere. Have the same love for everyone, with different flavors. You cannot behave the same way with everyone, but you can love all of them the same.

## Teaching #037: Knowledge and Faith
**Date:** March 1996  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** knowledge, faith, science, spirituality, organic_farming, pesticides  
**Keywords:** knowledge, faith, science, spirituality, organic, antibiotics, pesticides, happening  
**Problem Categories:** confusion_about_faith, blind_faith, scientific_materialism  
**Emotional States:** confusion_about_belief_systems  
**Life Situations:** choosing_between_science_and_spirituality  

### Content:
In science you have knowledge first, and then faith follows. In spirituality, faith comes first, and then Knowledge follows.

For example, the knowledge that pesticides and chemical fertilizers are good for plants came through science, and people had faith in it. And then another knowledge came that they were not good and the faith shifted to organic farming.

The knowledge and faith of science is of "happening." In spirituality, faith is first and Knowledge comes later. Science considers even human as matter, and spirituality considers even earth as mother, even rivers and mountains as living beings.

## Teaching #038: Respect
**Date:** April 1996  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** respect, qualities, greatness, self_respect, change, talents  
**Keywords:** respect, qualities, greatness, self_respect, change, talent, behavior, person  
**Problem Categories:** lack_of_respect, disrespect_from_others, self_worth  
**Emotional States:** feeling_disrespected, low_self_worth  
**Life Situations:** workplace_respect, self_respect, relationships  

### Content:
Why do you respect someone? Because of their good qualities, isn't it? For example, positive qualities like honesty, wisdom, love, talents, behavior. But all these change in time. And when they do change, you lose respect.

I have tremendous respect for each and every one. Not for their greatness or wisdom or talent, but for their very person. I respect everyone totally. So I can never lose respect for anybody, however they may be.

Don't look for respect from others; that makes you weak. Have respect for the self and no one can take your self-respect.

**Problem Categories:** endless_desires, not_being_present, seeking_happiness  
**Emotional States:** desire, restlessness, seeking_happiness  
**Life Situations:** goal_setting, being_present, happiness  

### Content:
All desires are for happiness. That is the goal of desire, isn't it? How often does your desire lead you to the goal? But have you thought about the nature of desire? It simply means tomorrow, and not now, isn't it?

Joy is never tomorrow. It is always now. How can you have desires when you are joyful? And how can you really be joyful now when you have desires?

Desire appears to lead you to happiness. In fact it cannot. And that is why it is Maya.

## Teaching #040: Faith and Love
**Date:** June 1996  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** faith, love, god, service, meditation, expression, strength, weakness  
**Keywords:** faith, love, god, service, meditation, expression, strength, weak, servant  
**Problem Categories:** excessive_faith, spiritual_pride, devotional_confusion  
**Emotional States:** excessive_devotion, spiritual_confusion  
**Life Situations:** spiritual_development, balanced_spirituality  

### Content:
God does not wish you to have more faith because the more faith you have, the more work for God. God will have to run behind you; then you start controlling Him. He is the servant of faithful servants and He does not want too many servants telling Him what He should be doing.

Love is the highest strength, yet it makes you absolutely weak. So God does not want you to have more faith or love. With too much faith and love, you make God weak.

Meditation is seeing God in oneself. Love is seeing God in the person next to you. Knowledge is seeing God everywhere. Expression of love is service. Expression of joy is smile. Expression of peace is meditation.

**Keywords:** questions, answers, hold, receive, hands, full, boy, guruji  
**Problem Categories:** too_many_questions, not_listening, impatience  
**Emotional States:** impatience, questioning_mind

A boy asked a question and before Guruji could answer, he was ready with another question.

To this Guruji said, "If you hold onto the question how will you receive the answer? Give away the question to me and then you will find that you are in the answer. If your hands are holding onto the question, how will you receive the answer? Your hands are already full with the question."

## Teaching #042: Blaming and Misery
**Date:** July 1996  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** blame, misery, seeker, worldly_person, quantum_leap, path, testing  
**Keywords:** blame, misery, seeker, worldly, path, knowledge, self, test, divine  
**Problem Categories:** blame_issues, spiritual_disappointment, path_confusion  
**Emotional States:** misery, blame, spiritual_disillusionment  
**Life Situations:** spiritual_path, dealing_with_setbacks  

### Content:
When a worldly man is miserable, he blames the people around him, the system, and the world in general. When a seeker is miserable he, of course, blames the world, but in addition he blames the path, the Knowledge, and himself.

It is better not to be a seeker so that you blame less. But then a seeker also enjoys everything much more. There is more love in life and more pain. When there is more joy, the contrast is greater.

A certain level of maturity is needed to see things as they are and not to blame the path, the self, and the world. The Divine does not test you. Testing is part of ignorance.

## Teaching #043: Attachments
**Date:** August 1996  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** attachments, breath, peace, surrender, sadhana, drowning, life_jacket  
**Keywords:** attachments, breath, peace, surrender, sadhana, resistance, feverish, drowning  
**Problem Categories:** attachment_issues, restlessness, lack_of_peace  
**Emotional States:** attachment, restlessness, scattered_feeling  
**Life Situations:** letting_go, spiritual_practice  

### Content:
Attachments cause feverish breath and feverish breath takes away peace of mind. Then you are in pieces and fall prey to misery. Before you get scattered too much, gather yourself and rid your breath of the feverishness through surrender and sadhana.

Unfortunately most people do not notice this until it is too late. When someone is drowning in the ocean of attachments, surrender is the life jacket they can put on and wait for the rescue team.

Your non-attachment to the mundane is your charm. Your attachment to the Divine is your beauty.

## Teaching #044: Vivek - Following Fun vs Knowledge
**Date:** September 1996  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** vivek, fun, knowledge, change, disowning, discrimination, sorrow  
**Keywords:** vivek, fun, knowledge, change, disown, blame, sorrow, overshadowed  
**Problem Categories:** lack_of_discrimination, following_wrong_things, feeling_alone  
**Emotional States:** following_wrong_pleasures, feeling_abandoned  
**Life Situations:** making_right_choices, discrimination  

### Content:
When you follow fun, misery follows you... When you follow Knowledge, fun follows you.

If you say that you have no one in this world, then you are disowning me. And if you disown me then I cannot do anything for you.

What is Vivek? Vivek means knowing that everything is changing. Time and again you have to awaken to this -- that the world, the people, our body, our emotions, are constantly changing. When you experience sorrow, understand that Vivek has been overshadowed.

You are not here to blame, cry, sleep, show off, fight, be miserable, be angry, or worry.

## Teaching #045: Words
**Date:** October 1996  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** words, meaning, brainwashing, disillusionment, wisdom, being  
**Keywords:** words, meaning, brainwashing, disillusionment, wisdom, being, manipulate, transcend  
**Problem Categories:** stuck_in_words, misunderstanding, communication_issues  
**Emotional States:** confusion_about_words, misunderstanding  
**Life Situations:** communication, understanding_deeper_meaning  

### Content:
We attach meaning to words and we distort them, too. For example, the word "brainwashing." Like your body, your brain needs washing sometimes. You don't want to walk around with a dirty brain, a dirty mind. What is wrong with the word "brainwashing?"

Like that, the word "disillusionment." It is good that you are disillusioned. You have come to reality. Don't be stuck with the words. Your worries are words. Your ideas are words. Wisdom is beyond words. It is the very Being.

If you manipulate words, it is a lie. If you play on words, it is a joke. If you rely on words, it is ignorance. If you transcend words, it is wisdom.

## Teaching #046: Karma
**Date:** November 1996  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** karma, bondage, logic, reasoning, grace, human_life, thief, police  
**Keywords:** karma, bondage, logic, reasoning, grace, thief, police, struggle, freedom  
**Problem Categories:** karma_confusion, feeling_stuck, victim_mentality  
**Emotional States:** feeling_stuck_by_karma, helplessness  
**Life Situations:** understanding_life_situations, karma_and_choice  

### Content:
Strange are the ways of Karma. The more you understand it, the more amazed you become. It brings people together and separates them. It causes some to be weak and some to be strong. It makes some rich and some poor.

All the struggle in the world, whatever it may be, is the bondage of Karma. It cuts across all logic and reasoning. This understanding will lift you from getting stuck to the events or personalities and help you in your Journey to the Self.

A thief can say it is my karma to steal? Then the police have the karma to catch him too! Only human life has the ability to be free from Karma. Only through Grace can the bondage of Karma be burnt.

## Teaching #047: Sanyas
**Date:** December 1996  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** sanyas, nothing, everything, company, attraction, delusion, knowledge, satsang  
**Keywords:** sanyas, nothing, everything, company, attraction, delusion, knowledge, satsang, colorless  
**Problem Categories:** spiritual_confusion, attachment_to_company, delusion  
**Emotional States:** confusion_about_renunciation, attachment  
**Life Situations:** spiritual_path, dealing_with_influences  

### Content:
Sanyas means what? I am nothing and I want nothing, or I am everything and I have everything. And Sanyas is being colorless or multicolored.

Your association or company can either elevate you or push you down. Company causes first an attraction and then delusion. This keeps your mind swinging between the two extremes and causes love and hatred.

With the power of Knowledge and Satsang you can rise above this dilemma.

## Teaching #048: Illusion
**Date:** January 1997  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** illusion, perception, experience, experiencer, reality, seer, hangover  
**Keywords:** illusion, perception, experience, experiencer, reality, seer, hangover, erroneous  
**Problem Categories:** confusion_about_reality, lost_in_experiences, spiritual_confusion  
**Emotional States:** confusion_about_what's_real, overwhelmed_by_experiences  
**Life Situations:** spiritual_inquiry, understanding_reality  

### Content:
Illusion is error of perception and knowing illusion as illusion is Knowledge. Our experience of the world is based on perception. Since every perception is erroneous, the world is an illusion.

Experiences are all of perception. The experiencer is the only reality. Look for the seer, the experiencer, in between experiences. Every experience leaves a hangover and clouds the intellect.

Wake up this moment. Shake your head of all past experiences and look at the pure Being that I am and that you are.

## Teaching #049: Self
**Date:** February 1997  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** self, mind_body, service, love, knowledge, life, values, yoga, meditation  
**Keywords:** self, mind, body, service, love, knowledge, life, values, yoga, meditation  
**Problem Categories:** identity_confusion, wrong_identification, life_purpose  
**Emotional States:** identity_crisis, confusion_about_purpose  
**Life Situations:** self_understanding, life_purpose  

### Content:
Self is not just the mind-body complex. Often people think of the Self as the mind-body complex. This is an erroneous notion. Neither the body nor the mind is the Self.

All the yoga you do is for the body. All the meditation you do is for the mind. Whether calm or disturbed, your mind remains mind. Whether sick or well, your body remains body. Self is all-encompassing.

Service without attitude, Love without reason, Knowledge without intellect, Life beyond time and events is what you are. The only purpose for this body to exist is to make you aware of how beautiful you are.

## Teaching #050: Enlightenment - Beyond Seasons
**Date:** March 1997  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** enlightenment, behavior, knowledge, consciousness, seasons, coconut_tree  
**Keywords:** enlightenment, behavior, knowledge, consciousness, seasons, coconut_tree, courses  
**Problem Categories:** judging_progress, spiritual_confusion, behavior_expectations  
**Emotional States:** disappointment_with_progress, confusion_about_growth  
**Life Situations:** spiritual_development, judging_others  

### Content:
Enlightenment is beyond seasons like the evergreen coconut tree. Sometimes the question comes up "What's the use of all these courses? Your behavior has not changed!"

The Knowledge acquired by a human being cannot be measured or judged by external behavior. Someone may behave as though they have absorbed all the Knowledge but internally they have not. The reverse is also true.

Behavior affects relationships. Attitude affects behavior. Knowledge or ignorance affects attitude. Grace brings forth Knowledge. Your inside is like a tree; in some seasons barren and at other times blossomed. Enlightenment is beyond seasons like the evergreen coconut tree.

## Teaching #051: Samadhi - Single Cell Universe
**Date:** March 1997  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** samadhi, unity, healing, sleep, awareness, bliss, doshas, single_cell  
**Keywords:** samadhi, cell, universe, healing, sleep, awareness, bliss, doshas, savitarka, nirvitarka  
**Problem Categories:** healing_issues, understanding_unity, meditation_confusion  
**Emotional States:** seeking_healing, wanting_unity_experience  
**Life Situations:** meditation, healing, understanding_oneness  

### Content:
A single cell becomes the whole body. Somewhere it is nails, somewhere it is nose and tongue but all is a manifestation of a single cell. In the same way, the entire universe is made up of a single substance.

Remembering and FEELING that everything is made up of one thing heals the body and mind and balances the doshas in the body. This is savitarka samadhi - equanimity with logical awareness.

Deep sleep can be jada samadhi (equanimity with inertia). Sleep is the main factor in healing. Samadhi with ecstasy has no logic. This is nirvitarka samadhi, awareness with bliss. Nirvitarka samadhi is even beyond the experience of bliss, undefinable beyond words.

## Teaching #052: What You Know
**Date:** April 1997  
**Location:** Germany  
**Topics:** knowledge, learning, unlearning, hollow, empty, talking, point  
**Keywords:** knowledge, learning, unlearning, hollow, empty, talking, point, know, don't_know  
**Problem Categories:** intellectual_confusion, over_thinking, spiritual_inquiry  
**Emotional States:** intellectual_confusion, over_analysis  
**Life Situations:** spiritual_inquiry, academic_pursuit  

### Content:
What shall we talk about today? What is the point in talking about something of which you know nothing. And so there is no point in talking about what you know and no point in talking about what you don't know!

We can talk about something you think you know but you don't know or something you think you don't know but you know. There is no end to learning but there is an end to unlearning. That is when you become totally hollow and empty.

## Teaching #053: Seva is Savior
**Date:** June 1996  
**Location:** St. Louis  
**Topics:** seva, service, consciousness, universal, personal, meditation, merit  
**Keywords:** seva, service, consciousness, universal, personal, meditation, merit, smile  
**Problem Categories:** self_centeredness, meditation_problems, lack_of_purpose  
**Emotional States:** self_centered_thinking, meditation_difficulties  
**Life Situations:** expanding_consciousness, deepening_meditation, finding_purpose  

### Content:
The way to expand from individual to universal consciousness is to share others's sorrow and joy. As you grow, your consciousness should also grow. When you expand in Knowledge with time, then depression is not possible.

The way to overcome personal misery is to share universal misery! The way to expand personal joy is to share universal joy. Instead of thinking "what about me?" think "what can I do for the world?"

If you are not having good experiences in meditation, then do more seva -- you will gain merit and your meditation will be deeper. Seva brings merit; merit allows you to go deep in meditation; meditation brings back your smile.

## Teaching #054: When We Are Joyful
**Date:** June 1996  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** joy, perfection, surface, depth, consciousness, satsang, wisdom  
**Keywords:** joy, perfection, surface, depth, consciousness, satsang, blurred, wisdom  
**Problem Categories:** seeking_perfection, surface_level_thinking, vision_problems  
**Emotional States:** perfectionism, surface_level_dissatisfaction  
**Life Situations:** seeking_depth, spiritual_development  

### Content:
When we are joyful, we don't look for perfection. If you are looking for perfection then you are not at the source of joy. Joy is the realization that there is no vacation from wisdom.

The world appears imperfect on the surface but underneath, all is perfect. Perfection hides; imperfection shows off. The wise will not stay on the surface but will probe into the depth.

Things are not blurred; your vision is blurred. Infinite actions prevail in the wholeness of consciousness. And yet the consciousness remains perfect, untouched.

## Teaching #055: Judgements and Good Company
**Date:** July 1996  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** judgement, company, approval, disapproval, change, love, compassion  
**Keywords:** judgement, company, approval, disapproval, change, love, compassion, air, breeze  
**Problem Categories:** judgmental_attitude, bad_company, relationship_issues  
**Emotional States:** being_judgmental, influenced_by_wrong_company  
**Life Situations:** choosing_company, relationships, decision_making  

### Content:
Though you have heard "don't judge," judgement comes unavoidably in day-to-day life. By the actions and behaviors of people, you either approve or disapprove. But always remember that everything is changing, and do not hold onto the judgement.

If judgements are lighter like air, like a breeze, they bring in fragrance, then move away. They should not stay there forever. Only in the state of Being when you are full of love and compassion can you ever be free from all judgements.

The company that drags you towards doubt, dejection, blame, complaints, anger, delusion, and desires is bad company. The company that pulls you up towards joy, enthusiasm, service, love, trust, and Knowledge is good company.

## Teaching #056: God is a Thorough Businessman
**Date:** July 1996  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** divine, prayers, rituals, bliss, sincerity, businessman, pleasure  
**Keywords:** divine, prayers, rituals, bliss, sincerity, businessman, trick, pleasure  
**Problem Categories:** insincere_prayers, trying_to_fool_god, spiritual_materialism  
**Emotional States:** trying_to_outsmart_divine, insincerity  
**Life Situations:** prayer_practice, spiritual_sincerity  

### Content:
The Divine has given you all the small pleasures in the world, but has kept the bliss to Himself. To get the highest bliss you have to go to Him and Him alone.

Don't be too smart with the Divine and try to fool Him. Most of your prayers and rituals are just attempts to trick the Divine. You try to give the least and get the maximum out of the Divine and He knows.

He's an astute businessman; He will trick you even more. Be sincere in your attempts. Do not try to outsmart the Divine. Once you get the bliss, then everything else is joyful.

## Teaching #057: Surrender and Responsibility
**Date:** August 1996  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** surrender, responsibility, goal, imagination, devotion, doership, thy_will  
**Keywords:** surrender, responsibility, goal, imagination, devotion, doership, thy_will, skill  
**Problem Categories:** confusion_about_surrender, irresponsibility, doership_issues  
**Emotional States:** confusion_about_action_vs_surrender  
**Life Situations:** taking_responsibility, spiritual_surrender  

### Content:
Setting up a time-bound goal gives direction to the life force. Imagination is essential for this. But if you are a devotee, you say "Let Thy Will be done" and then you will step lightly to the goal.

Some people say "Let God do everything and surrender" and others say "I have to be responsible." Surrender is saying "Let Thy Will be done" and "Thy Will" for you is to take responsibility for the whole world.

Total responsibility is total surrender. When you are taking responsibility and you find blocks, remember "surrender." Taking responsibility or surrendering without doership is the skill of the wise.

## Teaching #058: Respect Everybody as You Respect Me
**Date:** August 1996  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** respect, expectations, patience, fools, centeredness, wisdom, blessing  
**Keywords:** respect, expectations, patience, fools, centeredness, wisdom, blessing, curse  
**Problem Categories:** disrespecting_others, unrealistic_expectations, dealing_with_difficult_people  
**Emotional States:** frustration_with_people, lack_of_patience  
**Life Situations:** dealing_with_difficult_people, maintaining_respect  

### Content:
Respect everybody as you respect Me, but don't expect from everyone what you expect from Me. You do it the other way. You don't respect everybody as you respect Me, but you expect them to give you joy and behave ideally.

When they don't live up to your expectations, you get frustrated and you blame or curse them. By cursing, you lose your spiritual energy. Blessing brings your spiritual energy up.

If you find fools around you, they are going to make you wiser. The number of fools around you indicates the strength of your centeredness. Don't try to get rid of them! When you are totally established, you find the fools come up with wisdom.

## Teaching #059: Doing Versus Happening
**Date:** September 1996  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** doing, happening, past, present, future, work, doership, talents  
**Keywords:** doing, happening, past, present, future, work, doership, talents, ego, regret  
**Problem Categories:** doership_confusion, ego_issues, work_stress  
**Emotional States:** ego_about_achievements, work_fatigue  
**Life Situations:** work_life, understanding_action, ego_management  

### Content:
Only one who is 100 percent in doing can recognize the happening. The healthiest way to apply this knowledge is to see the whole past as happening and the present as doing.

If you see the past as doing, then ego and regret come along. And when you see the present as happening, then laziness and unawareness set in. Let the happening be for the past. Let the doing be for the present.

All the talents you have are for others. If you have good voice, it is for others. If you are a good cook, it is for others. So all of your talents are useful for others. If you don't make use of your talents, they will not be given to you again.

## Teaching #060: Don't Be Grateful - Be Great and Full
**Date:** July 1996  
**Location:** Hawaii  
**Topics:** gratitude, gratefulness, union, separation, master, great, full, celebration  
**Keywords:** grateful, gratitude, union, separation, master, great, full, celebration, belong  
**Problem Categories:** spiritual_separation, ego_in_gratitude, spiritual_union  
**Emotional States:** feeling_separate_from_divine, excessive_gratitude  
**Life Situations:** spiritual_relationship, devotion, union_with_divine  

### Content:
Warning! This Knowledge Sheet contains explosives! If you are grateful, you don't belong to Me! You are not part of the Master. When someone gives you something, you are grateful. That means you feel separate.

Gratefulness is inevitable. When you go beyond gratefulness, then union happens. No "I," no "you" remains. You are just One Being with a thousand heads and a thousand arms, but with one heart.

When you are grateful then you are the center. When you are grateful to God, who is important? You! So your gratitude indicates ego. Don't be grateful; just be great -- and be full!

## Teaching #061: Faith and Devotion
**Date:** August 1996  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** faith, devotion, head, heart, meditation, intellect, mature  
**Keywords:** faith, devotion, head, heart, meditation, intellect, mature, matter, abstract  
**Problem Categories:** imbalanced_spirituality, head_vs_heart_confusion  
**Emotional States:** spiritual_imbalance, intellectual_vs_emotional_confusion  
**Life Situations:** spiritual_development, balancing_head_and_heart  

### Content:
Faith is the subject of head. Devotion is the subject of heart. And meditation is of both and connects both.

A mature intellect is devoted. A mature heart is full of knowledge. And meditation matures your intellect as well as your heart.

People with good intellect seem to have less faith. They have more faith in the matter. Head puts the faith in the matter more and heart puts the faith in the abstract more. It's next to impossible that one can be in total lack of faith or total lack of devotion.

## Teaching #062: Infinite Patience and Smart Shopping
**Date:** August 1996  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** patience, god, boon, abundance, ownership, divine_plan, shopping  
**Keywords:** patience, god, boon, abundance, ownership, divine, plan, hurry, shopping, store  
**Problem Categories:** impatience, spiritual_materialism, demanding_attitude  
**Emotional States:** impatience, spiritual_greed, hurry  
**Life Situations:** spiritual_practice, waiting_for_results, trusting_divine_plan  

### Content:
Suppose you go to God, get a boon, and walk away. When your intention is to get a boon, then you are in a hurry. Another person who knows he owns God is not in a hurry for anything. Infinite patience comes up in him.

When you know you own God, you are not in a hurry to get something out of God. Your hurry to get something throws you off balance and makes you small. Have "eternal wait," infinite patience.

Patience in the mind and dynamism in action is the right formula.

## Teaching #063: Surrender, Shame and Shyness
**Date:** August 1996  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** surrender, shame, shyness, head, heart, arrogance, love, children  
**Keywords:** surrender, shame, shyness, head, heart, arrogance, love, children, beauty  
**Problem Categories:** arrogance, shame_issues, lack_of_natural_shyness  
**Emotional States:** arrogance, shame, natural_shyness  
**Life Situations:** spiritual_surrender, overcoming_shame, natural_beauty  

### Content:
In surrender the head bends and meets the heart. The head that does not bend has no value, and the head that is stiff will have to bend sometime, either in surrender or in shame.

The head that bends in surrender will never have to bend in shame. Shame accompanies arrogance. Shyness accompanies Love. See how children are endowed with shyness, that is natural.

Shame brings guilt and shyness adds to one's beauty. Retain your shyness and drop your shame.

## Teaching #064: Special or Ordinary
**Date:** September 1996

**Topics:** special, ordinary, perception, observation, expression, path, extraordinary  
**Keywords:** special, ordinary, perception, observation, expression, path, extraordinary, emotions  
**Problem Categories:** spiritual_pride, feeling_ordinary, ego_about_specialness  
**Emotional States:** spiritual_pride, feeling_special_or_ordinary  
**Life Situations:** spiritual_development, ego_management  

### Content:
Are you special or ordinary? What makes you special on the path? Your perception, observation, and expression have advanced. What makes you ordinary on the path is that you are special! Because everybody thinks they are very special in some way or another!

Your perception has improved. You see the cause behind every cause, the Divine, and you see the great plan behind every small plan. You don't see the intentions behind others's mistakes.

Before getting onto the path you never observed your emotions. Now you observe your emotions. Your expression has improved. And so you are extra... ordinary!

## Teaching #065: Whether You Win or Lose
**Date:** September 1996  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** arguments, belongingness, love, conflicts, krishna, arjuna, dancing  
**Keywords:** arguments, belongingness, love, conflicts, krishna, arjuna, dancing, play  
**Problem Categories:** relationship_conflicts, winning_losing_arguments, conflict_resolution  
**Emotional States:** argumentative, competitive, conflicted  
**Life Situations:** arguments, conflicts, relationships, competition  

### Content:
Whether you win or lose an argument with me you are still laughing. Why? Because there is total sense of belongingness. When there is a total sense of belongingness, real play happens. Winning or losing is irrelevant.

Normally what happens to you when you lose an argument? You are sad and upset, hurt and angry. But when you lose or win an argument with me you are still happy. How come? There is a sense of belongingness. Your love stands out and everything else becomes secondary.

Krishna's life was full of conflicts and yet he kept smiling and dancing. May you dance through the conflicts and contribute to this planet.

**Emotional States:** spiritual_unpreparedness, weakness  
**Life Situations:** spiritual_preparation, readiness_for_knowledge  

### Content:
If you pour water into a half baked pot, the pot becomes wasted and so does the water. If the pot is well baked and strong, then it does not matter whether you put the water into the pot or the pot into the water.

During Satsang that evening a devotee presents a beautiful hand crafted pot to Guruji. Another devotee presents a bouquet of roses. Placing the bouquet into the pot Guruji says, "If the pot is well baked, then it will hold the flowers."

When you blossom the sweets come to you.

**Emotional States:** feeling_misunderstood, inner_growth_not_recognized  
**Life Situations:** personal_development, being_misunderstood  

### Content:
You only see the fall of the water. You don't see how the Ocean becomes the Cloud. The ocean becoming the cloud is a secret, but the cloud becoming the ocean is obvious.

In the world only a few can notice your inner growth and height, but your outer expressions are apparent. Never brood that people don't understand you. They can only see your expression!

## Teaching #068: Which is More Expensive - Smile or Anger
**Date:** October 1996  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** smile, anger, expensive, cheap, ignorance, knowledge, costly  
**Keywords:** smile, anger, expensive, cheap, ignorance, knowledge, costly, diamond  
**Problem Categories:** anger_issues, not_smiling_enough, emotional_economy  
**Emotional States:** anger, lack_of_joy, emotional_imbalance  
**Life Situations:** emotional_management, daily_interactions  

### Content:
Do you get angry? If so, how often? I can but it's very expensive.

Usually, you give your anger freely and smile rarely as though a smile is costly. In ignorance, anger is cheaper and a smile is costly. In Knowledge, a smile is free like sun, air, and water and anger is extremely expensive like a diamond.

Conclusion: Make your Smile cheaper and anger expensive.

People who are free, regret that they don't have discipline. People who are disciplined look for the end. Look at the people who have no discipline; they are miserable. Freedom without discipline is absolute misery. Discipline without freedom is suffocating.

People who are in company all the time look for solitude. People who are in solitude feel lonely. People in cold places want warmth. People in warm places love something cool.

This is the dilemma of life: Everyone is looking for perfect balance. Perfect balance is like a razor's edge. It can only be found in the self.

**Keywords:** liar, innocent, trust, caught, good_liar, love, melt, mental_gymnastics

**Emotional States:** feeling_betrayed, loss_of_trust  
**Life Situations:** relationships, trust_issues, dealing_with_dishonesty

A dear person whom you trust lies to you and gets caught. What do you feel? Sadness, anger, cheated, disappointment, compassion, let down, loss of respect, wonder, shock, embarrassment.

Recently when someone lied to me, I felt happy and more love, for they were not a good liar. Had they been a good liar, they would not have been caught. I thought they were so innocent that they could not even lie properly.

You can never know a good liar. The person you call a liar is not a good liar and they are innocent. You need not go through all the mental gymnastics. Instead melt and dissolve in Love.

## Teaching #071: Attachments (Extended)
**Date:** November 1996  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** attachments, feverish_breath, peace, surrender, sadhana, drowning, ocean  
**Keywords:** attachments, breath, peace, surrender, sadhana, drowning, rescue, charm, beauty  
**Problem Categories:** attachment_issues, breathlessness, lack_of_peace  
**Emotional States:** attachment_anxiety, restlessness, scattered_feeling  
**Life Situations:** letting_go, spiritual_practice, finding_peace  

### Content:
Attachments cause feverish breath and feverish breath takes away peace of mind. Then you are in pieces and fall prey to misery. Before you get scattered too much, gather yourself and rid your breath of the feverishness through surrender and sadhana.

Unfortunately most people do not notice this until it is too late. When someone is drowning in the ocean of attachments, surrender is the life jacket they can put on and wait for the rescue team.

Your non-attachment to the mundane is your charm. Your attachment to the Divine is your beauty.

**Problem Categories:** lack_of_discrimination, following_pleasures, feeling_abandoned  
**Emotional States:** confusion_about_priorities, feeling_alone  
**Life Situations:** making_choices, spiritual_discrimination  

### Content:
When you follow fun, misery follows you... When you follow Knowledge, fun follows you.

If you say that you have no one in this world, then you are disowning me. And if you disown me then I cannot do anything for you.

What is Vivek? Vivek means knowing that everything is changing. Time and again you have to awaken to this -- that the world, the people, our body, our emotions, are constantly changing. When you experience sorrow, understand that Vivek has been overshadowed.

You are not here to blame, cry, sleep, show off, fight, be miserable, be angry, or worry.

## Teaching #073: Words (Extended)
**Date:** December 1996  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** words, meaning, distortion, brainwashing, disillusionment, wisdom, being  
**Keywords:** words, meaning, distortion, brainwashing, disillusionment, wisdom, being, manipulate  
**Problem Categories:** misunderstanding_words, communication_problems, stuck_in_concepts  
**Emotional States:** confusion_about_words, communication_anxiety  
**Life Situations:** communication, understanding_deeper_meanings  

### Content:
We attach meaning to words and we distort them, too. For example, the word "brainwashing." Like your body, your brain needs washing sometimes. What is wrong with the word "brainwashing?" It indicates a clean brain, a clean mind.

The word "disillusionment." It is good that you are disillusioned. You have come to reality. Don't be stuck with the words. Your worries are words. Your ideas are words. Wisdom is beyond words. It is the very Being.

If you manipulate words, it is a lie. If you play on words, it is a joke. If you rely on words, it is ignorance. If you transcend words, it is wisdom.

## Teaching #074: Karma (Extended)
**Date:** December 1996  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** karma, bondage, struggle, logic, reasoning, grace, human_life, freedom  
**Keywords:** karma, bondage, struggle, logic, reasoning, grace, human, thief, police, freedom  
**Problem Categories:** feeling_stuck_by_karma, victim_mentality, karmic_confusion  
**Emotional States:** helplessness_due_to_karma, feeling_bound  
**Life Situations:** understanding_life_situations, taking_responsibility  

### Content:
Strange are the ways of Karma. The more you understand it, the more amazed you become. It brings people together and separates them. It causes some to be weak and some to be strong. It makes some rich and some poor.

All the struggle in the world, whatever it may be, is the bondage of Karma. It cuts across all logic and reasoning. This understanding will lift you from getting stuck to the events or personalities and help you in your Journey to the Self.

So a thief can say it is my karma to steal? Then the police have the karma to catch him too! Only human life has the ability to be free from Karma. And only a few thousands aim to be free from it. Only through Grace can the bondage of Karma be burnt. Performing actions cannot eliminate Karma.

## Teaching #075: Sanyas (Extended)
**Date:** January 1997  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** sanyas, nothing, everything, colorless, multicolored, company, attraction, delusion  
**Keywords:** sanyas, nothing, everything, colorless, company, attraction, delusion, knowledge, satsang  
**Problem Categories:** confusion_about_renunciation, attachment_to_people, spiritual_confusion  
**Emotional States:** confusion_about_detachment, attachment_issues  
**Life Situations:** spiritual_path, dealing_with_influences, renunciation  

### Content:
Sanyas means what? I am nothing and I want nothing, or I am everything and I have everything. And Sanyas is being colorless or multicolored.

Your association or company can either elevate you or push you down. Company causes first an attraction and then delusion. This keeps your mind swinging between the two extremes and causes love and hatred.

With the power of Knowledge and Satsang you can rise above this dilemma.

## Teaching #076: Illusion (Extended)
**Date:** February 1997  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** illusion, perception, error, experience, experiencer, reality, seer, hangover  
**Keywords:** illusion, perception, error, experience, experiencer, reality, seer, hangover, being  
**Problem Categories:** confusion_about_reality, lost_in_experiences, illusion_of_world  
**Emotional States:** confusion_about_what's_real, overwhelmed_by_experiences  
**Life Situations:** spiritual_inquiry, meditation, understanding_reality  

### Content:
Illusion is error of perception and knowing illusion as illusion is Knowledge. Our experience of the world is based on perception. Since every perception is erroneous, the world is an illusion.

Experiences are all of perception. The experiencer is the only reality. Look for the seer, the experiencer, in between experiences. Every experience leaves a hangover and clouds the intellect.

Wake up this moment. Shake your head of all past experiences and look at the pure Being that I am and that you are. Are you really all here? Are you listening? Now close your eyes and see who is listening, who is questioning, who is sitting.

## Teaching #077: Self (Extended)
**Date:** March 1997  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** self, mind_body_complex, yoga, meditation, service, love, knowledge, values  
**Keywords:** self, mind, body, yoga, meditation, service, love, knowledge, values, beautiful  
**Problem Categories:** wrong_self_identification, identity_crisis, life_purpose_confusion  
**Emotional States:** identity_confusion, self_doubt, purposelessness  
**Life Situations:** self_understanding, spiritual_development, life_purpose  

### Content:
Self is not just the mind-body complex. Often people think of the Self as the mind-body complex. This is an erroneous notion. Neither the body nor the mind is the Self.

All the yoga you do is for the body. All the meditation you do is for the mind. Whether calm or disturbed, your mind remains mind. Whether sick or well, your body remains body. Self is all-encompassing.

Service without attitude, Love without reason, Knowledge without intellect, Life beyond time and events Is what you are. The only purpose for this body to exist is to make you aware of how beautiful you are, and to make you aware that it is possible to live all the values you cherish and create a world of divinity around you.

## Teaching #078: Enlightenment (Extended)
**Date:** March 1997  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** enlightenment, behavior, seasons, coconut_tree, consciousness, brahman, grace  
**Keywords:** enlightenment, behavior, seasons, coconut, tree, consciousness, brahman, grace, courses  
**Problem Categories:** judging_spiritual_progress, expectations_from_enlightened, behavior_focus  
**Emotional States:** disappointment_with_spiritual_progress, judging_others  
**Life Situations:** spiritual_development, understanding_enlightenment  

### Content:
Enlightenment is beyond seasons like the evergreen coconut tree. Sometimes the question comes up "What's the use of all these courses? Your behavior has not changed!"

The Knowledge acquired by a human being cannot be measured or judged by external behavior. Someone may behave as though they have absorbed all the Knowledge but internally they have not. The reverse is also true. Someone who seems to have not changed at all may have absorbed a lot.

Ordinary people would just look at the behavior, but the intelligent looks beyond and is amazed by the play of the consciousness. Behavior affects relationships. Attitude affects behavior. Knowledge or ignorance affects attitude. Grace brings forth Knowledge.

## Teaching #079: Samadhi (Extended)  
**Date:** April 1997  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** samadhi, universe, single_substance, healing, doshas, sleep, bliss, awareness  
**Keywords:** samadhi, universe, substance, healing, doshas, sleep, bliss, awareness, savitarka, nirvitarka  
**Problem Categories:** healing_issues, meditation_confusion, understanding_oneness  
**Emotional States:** seeking_healing, meditation_struggles, wanting_bliss  
**Life Situations:** meditation_practice, healing, spiritual_experiences  

### Content:
A single cell becomes the whole body. Somewhere it is nails, somewhere it is nose and tongue but all is a manifestation of a single cell. In the same way, the entire universe is made up of a single substance.

Remembering and FEELING that everything is made up of one thing heals the body and mind and balances the doshas in the body (vata, pitta and kapha). This is savitarka samadhi. Savitarka samadhi means equanimity with logical awareness.

Deep sleep can be jada samadhi (equanimity with inertia). And hence, sleep is the main factor in healing. Even medicines will not help without sleep and rest. Samadhi with ecstasy has no logic. This is nirvitarka samadhi, awareness with bliss. Nirvitarka samadhi is even beyond the experience of bliss, undefinable beyond words.

## Teaching #080: What You Know (Extended)
**Date:** May 1997  
**Location:** Holland to German Ashram  
**Topics:** knowledge, talking, learning, unlearning, hollow, empty, point  
**Keywords:** knowledge, talking, learning, unlearning, hollow, empty, point, nothing  
**Problem Categories:** intellectual_confusion, over_analysis, spiritual_inquiry  
**Emotional States:** intellectual_confusion, over_thinking  
**Life Situations:** spiritual_inquiry, philosophical_discussions  

### Content:
What shall we talk about today? What is the point in talking about something of which you know nothing. And so... there is no point in talking about what you know and no point in talking about what you don't know!

"What about something you think you know but don't know?" "We can talk about something you think you know but you don't know or something you think you don't know but you know."

There is no end to learning but there is an end to unlearning. That is when you become totally hollow and empty.

## Teaching #081: Seva is Savior (Extended)
**Date:** June 1997  
**Location:** St. Louis (One Year Anniversary)  
**Topics:** seva, individual_consciousness, universal_consciousness, depression, meditation, merit  
**Keywords:** seva, consciousness, universal, individual, depression, meditation, merit, smile  
**Problem Categories:** self_centeredness, depression, meditation_problems, lack_of_contribution  
**Emotional States:** self_centered, depressed, poor_meditation  
**Life Situations:** expanding_perspective, community_service, deepening_practice  

### Content:
The way to expand from individual to universal consciousness is to share others's sorrow and joy. As you grow, your consciousness should also grow. When you expand in Knowledge with time, then depression is not possible. Your inner most source is joy.

The way to overcome personal misery is to share universal misery! The way to expand personal joy is to share universal joy. Instead of thinking "what about me?" "what can I gain from this world?" think "what can I do for the world?"

When everyone comes from the point of contributing to society, you have a Divine society. If you are not having good experiences in meditation, then do more seva -- you will gain merit and your meditation will be deeper. Seva brings merit; merit allows you to go deep in meditation; meditation brings back your smile.

## Teaching #082: When We Are Joyful (Extended)
**Date:** July 1997  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** joy, perfection, wisdom, surface, depth, consciousness, satsang  
**Keywords:** joy, perfection, wisdom, surface, depth, consciousness, satsang, blurred, vacation  
**Problem Categories:** perfectionism, surface_thinking, blurred_vision, lack_of_joy  
**Emotional States:** seeking_perfection, surface_dissatisfaction, lack_of_depth  
**Life Situations:** finding_joy, developing_depth, spiritual_insight  

### Content:
When we are joyful, we don't look for perfection. If you are looking for perfection then you are not at the source of joy. Joy is the realization that there is no vacation from wisdom. The world appears imperfect on the surface but underneath, all is perfect.

Perfection hides; imperfection shows off. The wise will not stay on the surface but will probe into the depth. Things are not blurred; your vision is blurred. Infinite actions prevail in the wholeness of consciousness. And yet the consciousness remains perfect, untouched.

As Satsangees, realize this now and be at Home. You better straighten out and become we. We are always one and you could be two.

## Teaching #083: Judgements and Good Company (Extended)
**Date:** August 1997  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** judgement, company, air, breeze, fragrance, bad_company, good_company  
**Keywords:** judgement, company, air, breeze, fragrance, bad, good, complain, solidified  
**Problem Categories:** being_judgmental, choosing_wrong_company, negative_influences  
**Emotional States:** being_judgmental, influenced_by_negativity, complaining  
**Life Situations:** choosing_friends, workplace_relationships, spiritual_community  

### Content:
Though you have heard "don't judge," judgement comes unavoidably in day-to-day life. By the actions and behaviors of people, you either approve or disapprove. But always remember that everything is changing, and do not hold onto the judgement. Otherwise your judgement gets solidified like a rock.

If judgements are lighter like air, like a breeze, they bring in fragrance, then move away. They could bring a foul smell, then move away. They should not stay there forever. Judgements are so subtle that you are not even aware of their existence. Judging or labeling someone as judgmental is also a judgement.

Your company can create Hell for you in Heaven -- or Heaven for you in Hell. Judge for yourself...! When someone complains, first you listen, then you nod, then you sympathize, then you complain.

## Teaching #084: God is a Thorough Businessman (Extended)
**Date:** September 1997  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** divine, businessman, pleasures, bliss, prayers, rituals, sincerity, astute  
**Keywords:** divine, businessman, pleasures, bliss, prayers, rituals, sincerity, trick, astute  
**Problem Categories:** spiritual_materialism, insincere_prayers, trying_to_fool_divine  
**Emotional States:** spiritual_greed, insincerity_in_practice  
**Life Situations:** prayer_practice, spiritual_sincerity, devotion  

### Content:
The Divine has given you all the small pleasures in the world, but has kept the bliss to Himself. To get the highest bliss you have to go to Him and Him alone.

Don't be too smart with the Divine and try to fool Him. Most of your prayers and rituals are just attempts to trick the Divine. You try to give the least and get the maximum out of the Divine and He knows. He's an astute businessman; He will trick you even more.

If you go underneath the carpet, He will go underneath the floor. Be sincere in your attempts. Do not try to outsmart the Divine. Once you get the bliss, then everything else is joyful. Without the bliss, joy in anything in the world will not stay.

## Teaching #085: Surrender and Responsibility (Extended)
**Date:** October 1997  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** surrender, responsibility, time_bound_goal, imagination, devotion, doership, skill  
**Keywords:** surrender, responsibility, goal, imagination, devotion, doership, skill, wise, blocks  
**Problem Categories:** confusion_about_surrender, irresponsibility, doership_burden  
**Emotional States:** confusion_about_action, burden_of_responsibility  
**Life Situations:** goal_setting, spiritual_surrender, taking_responsibility  

### Content:
Setting up a time-bound goal gives direction to the life force. Imagination is essential for this. Most people have a small imagination and are stuck with that, and that causes frustration. But if you are a devotee, you say "Let Thy Will be done" and then you will step lightly to the goal.

Some people say "Let God do everything and surrender" and others say "I have to be responsible." Surrender is saying "Let Thy Will be done" and "Thy Will" for you is to take responsibility for the whole world.

Total responsibility is total surrender. It's a little hard to chew, but this is the truth. People usually say either I take responsibility or surrender, but I tell you they go hand in hand. Taking responsibility or surrendering without doership is the skill of the wise. Limited responsibility makes you weak. Unlimited responsibility empowers you and brings you joy.

## Teaching #086: Respect Everybody (Extended)
**Date:** November 1997  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** respect, expectations, forbearance, wisdom, fools, centeredness, blessing, curse  
**Keywords:** respect, expectations, forbearance, wisdom, fools, centeredness, blessing, curse, energy  
**Problem Categories:** unrealistic_expectations, lack_of_patience, dealing_with_difficult_people  
**Emotional States:** frustration_with_people, cursing_others, impatience  
**Life Situations:** managing_relationships, dealing_with_fools, spiritual_energy  

### Content:
Respect everybody as you respect Me, but don't expect from everyone what you expect from Me. You do it the other way. You don't respect everybody as you respect Me, but you expect them to give you joy and behave ideally.

When they don't live up to your expectations, you get frustrated and you blame or curse them. By cursing, you lose your spiritual energy. Blessing brings your spiritual energy up. The world is full of differences and arguments are inevitable. With forbearance or patience and wisdom, skillfully make your way up.

If you find fools around you, they are going to make you wiser. The number of fools around you indicates the strength of your centeredness. Don't try to get rid of them! If you are not centered you will have no patience to put up with them. When you are totally established, you find the fools come up with wisdom.

## Teaching #087: Doing Versus Happening (Extended)
**Date:** December 1997  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** doing, happening, past, present, future, work, talents, others, surgery  
**Keywords:** doing, happening, past, present, future, work, talents, others, surgery, teacher  
**Problem Categories:** doership_confusion, ego_in_work, work_exhaustion  
**Emotional States:** ego_about_work, work_fatigue, doership_burden  
**Life Situations:** work_life, using_talents, understanding_service  

### Content:
Only one who is 100 percent in doing can recognize the happening. The healthiest way to apply this knowledge is to see the whole past as happening and the present as doing. If you see the past as doing, then ego and regret come along.

If you apply the doing for the future, it brings tension and worry. If you apply the happening for the future, it might bring some confidence and also lethargy. The wise will see the doing in happening and the happening in doing simultaneously.

One who does a lot of work will never say he did a lot. Work does not tire you as much as the doership does. All the talents you have are for others. If you have good voice, it is for others. If you are a good carpenter, it is for others. You cannot do your own surgery. This is interesting. If you are school teacher, it is for others. You cannot teach your own children; they don't listen to you anyway.

## Teaching #088: Don't Be Grateful (Extended)
**Date:** January 1998  
**Location:** Hawaii  
**Topics:** gratitude, gratefulness, union, master, great, full, celebration, one_being  
**Keywords:** grateful, gratitude, union, master, great, full, celebration, one_being, rights  
**Problem Categories:** spiritual_separation, ego_in_gratitude, excessive_gratitude  
**Emotional States:** feeling_separate, gratitude_creating_ego  
**Life Situations:** spiritual_relationship, true_celebration, union_with_divine  

### Content:
Warning! Watch out! This Knowledge Sheet contains explosives! How many of you are grateful here? If you are grateful, you don't belong to Me! You are not part of the Master. When someone gives you something, you are grateful. That means you feel separate. You are not grateful to yourself.

When you are grateful then you are the center, you are more important. When you are grateful to God for having received something beautiful, for example, eyesight, who is important? You or God? You! So your gratitude indicates ego.

I am simply great and I am full! Don't be grateful; just be great -- and be full! When you are part of the Master, you have every right to be happy. You have every right to Knowledge, happiness, and the whole universe! This is true celebration: thanking yourself!

## Teaching #089: Faith and Devotion (Extended)
**Date:** February 1998  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** faith, devotion, head, heart, meditation, mature_intellect, mature_heart  
**Keywords:** faith, devotion, head, heart, meditation, mature, intellect, abstract, balance  
**Problem Categories:** spiritual_imbalance, head_heart_conflict, immature_devotion  
**Emotional States:** spiritual_imbalance, intellectual_vs_emotional_conflict  
**Life Situations:** developing_mature_spirituality, balancing_faith_and_devotion  

### Content:
Faith is the subject of head. Devotion is the subject of heart. And meditation is of both and connects both.

A mature intellect is devoted. A mature heart is full of knowledge. And meditation matures your intellect as well as your heart.

But people with good intellect seem to have less faith. They have more faith in the matter. Head puts the faith in the matter more and heart puts the faith in the abstract more. It's next to impossible that one can be in total lack of faith or total lack of devotion. It's only a question of balance.

## Teaching #090: Infinite Patience (Extended)
**Date:** March 1998  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** patience, god, ownership, divine_plan, hurry, balance, shopping, store  
**Keywords:** patience, god, ownership, divine, plan, hurry, balance, shopping, store, home  
**Problem Categories:** impatience, spiritual_materialism, hurrying_with_god  
**Emotional States:** impatience, spiritual_greed, hurried_mind  
**Life Situations:** spiritual_practice, waiting_for_divine_grace, patient_devotion  

### Content:
Suppose you go to God, get a boon, and walk away. When your intention is to get a boon, then you are in a hurry. Another person who knows he owns God is not in a hurry for anything. Infinite patience comes up in him.

When you know you own God, you are not in a hurry to get something out of God. Your hurry to get something throws you off balance and makes you small. Have "eternal wait," infinite patience. When you have infinite patience, you will realize God belongs to you.

It's not like shopping at the supermarket in a hurry and rushing back home. When you see the whole store is at home, you are not in a hurry to shop. You are at ease. When you know you are part of the divine plan, you stop demanding. Then you know everything is being done for you.

## Teaching #091: Surrender, Shame and Shyness (Extended)
**Date:** April 1998  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** surrender, shame, shyness, head_bending, heart, arrogance, love, children  
**Keywords:** surrender, shame, shyness, head, heart, arrogance, love, children, beauty, guilt  
**Problem Categories:** arrogance_issues, shame_problems, loss_of_natural_shyness  
**Emotional States:** arrogance, shame, natural_shyness, guilt  
**Life Situations:** spiritual_surrender, overcoming_shame, maintaining_natural_beauty  

### Content:
In surrender the head bends and meets the heart. The head that does not bend has no value, and the head that is stiff will have to bend sometime, either in surrender or in shame.

The head that bends in surrender will never have to bend in shame. Shame accompanies arrogance. Shyness accompanies Love. See how children are endowed with shyness, that is natural. Shyness is inherent. Shame is inflicted by society and is acquired.

Shame brings guilt and shyness adds to one's beauty. Retain your shyness and drop your shame.

## Teaching #092: Special or Ordinary (Extended)
**Date:** May 1998  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** special, ordinary, perception, observation, expression, doubting_thomas  
**Keywords:** special, ordinary, perception, observation, expression, doubting, thomas, extraordinary  
**Problem Categories:** spiritual_pride, feeling_ordinary, ego_about_specialness  
**Emotional States:** spiritual_ego, feeling_special, ordinariness  
**Life Situations:** spiritual_development, self_assessment, ego_management  

### Content:
Are you special or ordinary? What makes you special on the path? Your perception, observation, and expression have advanced. What makes you ordinary on the path is that you are special! Because everybody thinks they are very special in some way or another!

Your perception has improved. You see the cause behind every cause, the Divine, and you see the great plan behind every small plan. You don't see the intentions behind others's mistakes and you are not a doubting Thomas.

Before getting onto the path you never observed your emotions. Now you observe your emotions, positive or negative, love or hatred, anger or compassion, pain or pleasure. Your observation has improved. Your expression has improved. And so... you are extra... ordinary!

## Teaching #093: Whether You Win or Lose (Extended)
**Date:** June 1998  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** win, lose, argument, belongingness, love, confidence, ultimate_good, dancing  
**Keywords:** win, lose, argument, belongingness, love, confidence, ultimate, good, dancing, krishna  
**Problem Categories:** competitive_attitude, argument_addiction, conflict_in_relationships  
**Emotional States:** competitive, argumentative, conflicted, sad_after_losing  
**Life Situations:** arguments, competitions, relationships, conflicts  

### Content:
Whether you win or lose an argument with me you are still laughing. Why? Because there is total sense of belongingness. When there is a total sense of belongingness, real play happens. Winning or losing is irrelevant.

Normally what happens to you when you lose an argument? You are sad and upset, hurt and angry. But when you lose or win an argument with me you are still happy. How come? There is a sense of belongingness. Your love stands out and everything else becomes secondary. Your ability to put the "Being" before the happening. And your confidence in the ultimate good.

Can't you have this same attitude with everyone? Today is Krishna's birthday. Krishna's life was full of conflicts and yet he kept smiling and dancing. May you dance through the conflicts and contribute to this planet.

**Keywords:** pot, baked, water, flowers, sweets, blossoming, strength, hold, sandesh, devotee  
**Problem Categories:** spiritual_weakness, not_being_prepared, half_baked_development  
**Emotional States:** spiritual_unpreparedness, weakness_in_practice  
**Life Situations:** spiritual_preparation, readiness_for_knowledge, strength_building  

### Content:
If you pour water into a half baked pot, the pot becomes wasted and so does the water. If the pot is well baked and strong, then it does not matter whether you put the water into the pot or the pot into the water.

During Satsang that evening a devotee presents a beautiful hand crafted pot to Guruji. Another devotee presents a bouquet of roses. Placing the bouquet into the pot Guruji says, "If the pot is well baked, then it will hold the flowers."

Yet another gift of sweets is given to Guruji and He adds, "When you blossom the sweets come to you." Then came a box of (Sandesh) Sweets and Guruji concluded, "This is today's sandesh." (Sandesh is the Hindi word for message.)

## Teaching #095: The Fall That Raises (Extended)
**Date:** August 1998  
**Location:** Not specified  
**Topics:** fall, ocean_to_cloud, inner_growth, outer_expression, understanding  
**Keywords:** fall, ocean, cloud, growth, expression, secret, obvious, understand, brood  
**Problem Categories:** not_being_understood, inner_development_not_seen, feeling_misunderstood  
**Emotional States:** feeling_misunderstood, inner_growth_not_recognized  
**Life Situations:** personal_development, being_misunderstood  

### Content:
You only see the fall of the water. You don't see how the Ocean becomes the Cloud. The ocean becoming the cloud is a secret, but the cloud becoming the ocean is obvious.

In the world only a few can notice your inner growth and height, but your outer expressions are apparent. Never brood that people don't understand you. They can only see your expression!
