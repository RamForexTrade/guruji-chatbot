### Content:
Beyond an event is Knowledge. Beyond a person is love. Beyond an object is infinity.

Knowledge is not in an event; it is beyond an event. If you take one event and infer anything from one event -- infer knowledge -- it will be erroneous knowledge. Say Nancy gets angry and shouts at someone. You attribute anger to Nancy, but actually it was carried from someone else to her. Someone else got angry first and someone else and someone else and on and on like that.

When you go beyond an event, only then the truth dawns. One particular event gives you a false notion. So you have to consider the totality of events, the totality of all events infinitely. Beyond the event is Knowledge.

What do we call a person? A person is a body, a mind, a complex of behaviors which is changing. Love is unchanging. Beyond the person is love.

When you lose your personality, you become love. If you cannot lose yourself, you cannot find yourself. So, lose your personality; you'll find yourself!!!

Behind every object is infinity. An object is limited. Take an object and reduce, reduce, reduce, and you have an atom. An atom is infinity. Each atom contains infinite space. Beyond the object is infinity.

The object behind the object is infinity. The person behind the person is love.

Maya is getting caught up in the event, personality, object. Knowledge, love, Brahman is seeing beyond the event, personality, or object. See? Just a little shift.

## Teaching #002: Close to the Master
**Date:** June 21, 1995  
**Location:** Big Sur  
**Topics:** guru_relationship, devotion, intimacy, master_disciple, communication, sharing  
**Keywords:** guru, master, close, intimate, share, heart, formal, superficial, burden  
**Problem Categories:** spiritual_relationship, feeling_distant_from_guru, devotion_issues  
**Emotional States:** feeling_disconnected, longing, shame, judgment  
**Life Situations:** spiritual_practice, guru_relationship  

### Content:
If you're not feeling close to the Guru, it's because of you. Because of your mind, because of your ego concepts. Share with the Guru that which is very important or intimate to you. Share that. Do not feel shame, shy, or judgmental about yourself.

Unless you express to the Master that which is very intimate and important to you, just being on the formal and informal communication levels cannot make you feel close. "How are you, where are you going? How have you been?" Stop formal and superficial conversations with the Master and speak with your heart that which is very important and intimate, very deep to your life. Don't just say how much the squash costs, 30 cents or whatever.

If you don't feel close to the Master, there's no point in having a Master. It is just another burden to you. You have enough already. Just say "Goodbye," get rid of it.

**Question:** When you play little games and push us away, how can we feel close to you?

**Answer:** You should feel more close if you are pushed away, scolded or ignored. Because to ignore somebody takes a lot of effort. When a Master does not even ignore wrapping paper, or a flower that is in a vase, how can he ignore a walking, talking, breathing human being who is connected? How could that be ignored? So when you understand this, you already feel close.

## Teaching #003: The Nature of Knowledge
**Date:** June 21, 1995  
**Location:** Big Sur  
**Topics:** knowledge, wisdom, understanding, learning, guru, teaching  
**Keywords:** knowledge, wisdom, learn, understand, guru, teaching, student, master  
**Problem Categories:** seeking_knowledge, spiritual_learning, understanding_truth  
**Emotional States:** curiosity, seeking, confusion, wonder  
**Life Situations:** spiritual_study, philosophical_inquiry, learning_journey  

### Content:
Knowledge is structured in consciousness. Consciousness is the field of all possibilities. In the field of all possibilities, you can have any experience. Any experience is possible in the field of consciousness.

Knowledge has organizing power. Knowledge can organize any experience for you. If you want any experience, you can have it through knowledge. Knowledge is not just information. Information is just the superficial understanding of knowledge.

Knowledge is that which transforms you. Knowledge is that which brings about a change in your consciousness. Real knowledge is that which makes you more and more established in your Self.

The difference between information and knowledge is this: Information is outside of you. Knowledge is inside of you. Information you can gather from books, from people, from experiences. But knowledge has to dawn from within. It has to blossom from within your consciousness.

When knowledge dawns, transformation happens automatically. You don't have to make any effort for transformation. The knowledge itself transforms you.

## Teaching #004: On Happiness and Joy
**Date:** June 21, 1995  
**Location:** Big Sur  
**Topics:** happiness, joy, bliss, contentment, peace, inner_joy  
**Keywords:** happiness, joy, bliss, content, peace, smile, laughter, celebration  
**Problem Categories:** seeking_happiness, depression, sadness, emotional_pain  
**Emotional States:** sad, depressed, joyful, content, peaceful, seeking_joy  
**Life Situations:** daily_life, relationships, work_stress, personal_struggles  

### Content:
Happiness is your nature. You don't have to work towards happiness. You have to work towards removing the obstacles to happiness.

What are the obstacles to happiness? Wanting something, craving for something, hankering for something - this is an obstacle to happiness. When you don't hanker for anything, you are naturally happy.

Joy is different from happiness. Happiness depends on happenings. Joy does not depend on happenings. Joy is your very nature. Even in the most adverse circumstances, that inner joy can be maintained.

Bliss is even deeper than joy. Bliss is when you have transcended both joy and sorrow. Bliss is when you are established in your Self, when you are not shaken by any external circumstances.

The secret of happiness is this: Don't try to be happy. Be natural. In being natural, happiness happens. When you are artificial, when you are trying to be something that you are not, then misery happens.

Smile more, laugh more, celebrate more. Life is a celebration. Life is not a punishment. Life is not a trial. Life is a gift, and this gift is to be celebrated.

## Teaching #005: Dealing with Problems
**Date:** June 21, 1995  
**Location:** Big Sur  
**Topics:** problems, challenges, obstacles, solutions, wisdom, acceptance  
**Keywords:** problem, solution, challenge, obstacle, difficulty, worry, stress, overcome  
**Problem Categories:** life_problems, stress, worry, anxiety, problem_solving  
**Emotional States:** worried, stressed, anxious, overwhelmed, frustrated  
**Life Situations:** work_challenges, relationship_issues, health_problems, financial_stress  

### Content:
Every problem has a solution. If there is no solution, then it is not a problem - it is a fact of life that you need to accept.

Problems are not your enemies. Problems are your teachers. They teach you something. They make you grow. They make you mature. Without problems, you would remain immature.

When you have a problem, first see if there is anything you can do about it. If there is something you can do, then do it. If there is nothing you can do, then accept it gracefully.

Most of our problems are created by our own minds. We take a small thing and make it into a big problem through our imagination, through our fears, through our worries.

The art of living is knowing when to act and when to accept. When you can change something, change it. When you cannot change something, accept it and move on.

Remember: This too shall pass. No problem is permanent. Every situation changes. Every phase passes. Have patience and keep your wisdom alive.

Don't make problems bigger than they are. Don't make yourself smaller than you are. You are much bigger than any problem that life can give you.
